# Seven Weeks of Fonts

###Project Introduction

Typography is a critical piece of the web design puzzle. At it’s most basic, it makes your site easy to read and understand. It can also express emotion, add significant depth and richness to layouts, and guide users’ assumptions about the site or product.

The choices a designer makes around typography are calculated, precise, and deeply thought through. As a developer, it’s important to understand and honor this whether you are working from comps provided by a designer or as you design a site yourself.

To help gain a better understanding of how we can use typography and fonts as tools for visual expression, I did a variation of a common Intro to Typography exercise. This project will enforce the concept that type can be used as a visual communication tool which enhances the meaning and emotion of the content beyond simply conveying text.

###Project Overview

Manipulating type in expressive, creative ways is an interesting CSS layout challenge, and developing the skill of choosing fonts that pair nicely together takes time. Drawing inspiration from the Yale School of Art’s 100 Days project, I built a new typographic experiment every week for my second module. The end deliverable is a one page site that shows the full collection of type exercises. 

To help build typography and layout skills simultaneously, I made my challenges revolve around working with pre-selected font pairings and text snippets. As the first 4 weeks were provided for, my job was to make a responsive and expressive layout using them. I asked myself the following questions: What feelings does the copy convey and how do I express that typographically? How can that be communicated through layout, scale, and color?
